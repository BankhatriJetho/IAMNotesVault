IAM/IGA Metrics
=====================
	Metrics are essential for tracking the effectiveness of IAM/IGA programs, identifying weaknesses, and 	demonstrating compliance to stakeholders.

1. Why Metrics Matter
	Measure Success: Quantify the impact of IAM/IGA initiatives.
	Identify Gaps: Detect areas needing improvement (e.g., excessive access or delayed deprovisioning).
	Demonstrate Compliance: Provide evidence for audits and regulatory reporting.

2. Key IAM/IGA Metrics
	Provisioning Time:
	Measures how quickly new users are onboarded or roles are updated.
	Goal: Minimize time to ensure productivity while maintaining security.
	Example:
		Average time to provision access to new hires: 2 hours.
	
	Deprovisioning Time:
	Measures how quickly access is revoked after an employee leaves.
	Goal: Immediate deprovisioning to avoid insider threats.
	Example:
		Average deprovisioning time: 1 business day.
	
	Access Review Completion Rate:
	Tracks the percentage of access reviews completed within the deadline.
	Goal: 100% completion rate.
	Example:
		Q2 Access Review Completion: 95% (5% overdue).

	Dormant Account Rate:
	Measures the percentage of accounts that havenâ€™t been accessed for a defined period.
	Goal: Keep dormant accounts below 2%.
	Example:
		Dormant Accounts in Q2: 1.5% of total accounts.

	SOD Violation Count:
	Tracks the number of identified and unresolved SOD violations.
	Goal: Zero unresolved SOD violations.
	Example:
		Unresolved SOD Violations: 3 (all under investigation).

	Audit Findings:
	Tracks the number of audit issues related to IAM/IGA.
	Goal: No major findings during audits.
	Example:
	Last Audit: 1 minor issue (documentation gap).

3. Advanced Metrics
	Role Optimization:
	Percentage of roles aligned with least privilege principles.
	Goal: 90%+ optimized roles.

	Access Request Approval Time:
	Average time it takes managers to approve/reject access requests.
	Goal: Less than 1 business day.
	
	Password Reset Frequency:
	Tracks how often users reset passwords (indicates password policy effectiveness).
	Goal: Reduce unnecessary resets to improve productivity.
	
	Privileged Account Monitoring:
	Number of privileged accounts with abnormal usage patterns.
	Goal: Zero abnormal activity.
